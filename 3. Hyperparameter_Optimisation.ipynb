{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Tuning Hyperparameters\n","\n","There are many machine learning algorithms that require *hyperparameters* (parameter values that influence training, but can't be determined from the training data itself). For example, when training a logistic regression model, you can use a *regularization rate* hyperparameter to counteract bias in the model; or when training a convolutional neural network, you can use hyperparameters like *learning rate* and *batch size* to control how weights are adjusted and how many data items are processed in a mini-batch respectively. The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly affect the performance of a trained model, or the time taken to train it; and often you need to try multiple combinations to find the optimal solution.\n","\n","In this case, you'll use a simple example of a logistic regression model with a single hyperparameter, but the principles apply to any kind of model you can train with Azure Machine Learning.\n","\n","## Connect to Your Workspace\n","\n","The first thing you need to do is to connect to your workspace using the Azure ML SDK.\n","\n","> **Note**: You may be prompted to authenticate.
