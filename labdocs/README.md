# Building, Training, and Validating Models in Azure Labs

Use the following lab exercises to complete the course.

Before completing each lab, I recommend you complete the associated lessons on [Building, Training, and Validating Models in Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-building-training-validating-models/table-of-contents).

## Lab Exercises

- [Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](Lab01.md)
- [Working with Data](Lab02.md)
- [Build & Register the Model](Lab03.md)
- [Hyperparameter Optimisation](Lab04.md)
- [Deploy the Model](Lab05.md)
- [Model Retrain with Azure AutoML](Lab06.md)
- [Monitoring the Model](Lab07.md)
- [Monitoring Data Drift](Lab08.md)

> **Note**: For the best experience, complete the labs in the order in which they are listed above. You ***must*** complete at least the first two tasks in [Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](Lab01.md) to provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace and create a compute instance before completing any other labs.
